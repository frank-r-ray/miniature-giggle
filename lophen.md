### Alternate Racial Traits:
- Dreamspeaker (-Elven Immunities)
> A few elves have the ability to tap into the power of sleep, dreams, and prescient reverie. Elves with this racial trait add +1 to the saving throw DCs of spells of the divination school and sleep effects they cast. In addition, elves with Charisma scores of 15 or higher may use dream once per day as a spell-like ability (caster level is equal to the elf’s character level). This racial trait replaces elven immunities.

The selected skills are always class skills for the character. This trait replaces racial weapon familiarity.

### Traits
- Elven Reflexes
> You gain a +2 trait bonus on initiative checks.

### Equipment
Starting Money: 120gp

### Class: Witch
- Archtype: None

## Class Features
- Hex
> Witches learn a number of magic tricks, called hexes, that grant them powers or weaken foes. At 1st level, a witch gains one hex of her choice. She gains an additional hex at 2nd level and for every 2 levels attained after 2nd level, as noted on Table: Witch. A witch cannot select an individual hex more than once.
- Major Hex
> Starting at 10th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following major hexes whenever she could select a new hex.
- Cantrips
> Witches can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Table: Witch under "Spells per Day." These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again. Cantrips prepared using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats for example, are expended normally.
- Spells
> A witch casts arcane spells drawn from the witch spell list. A witch must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time.
>
> To learn or cast a spell, a witch must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a witch’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the witch’s Intelligence modifier.
>
> A witch can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Witch. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).
>
> A witch may know any number of spells. She must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour communing with her familiar. While communing, the witch decides which spells to prepare.
>
> Unless otherwise noted, using a hex is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The save to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the witch’s level + the witch’s Intelligence modifier.
